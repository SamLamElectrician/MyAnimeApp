					<h2>Welcome To Sam's Anime List Project</h2>

						This is my react project where I compile data from the Jikan API to
						return a list of random animes on the home page. You can also query
						for the anime that you would want to watch! I am currently working
						on the functionality of including firebase to store your list and a
						google sign in option.
